# Design-Patterns

## Singleton Design Pattern
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

## Factory Design Pattern
A Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

## Adapter Design Pattern
An Adapter Pattern says that just "converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client wants". In other words, to provide the interface according to client requirement while using the services of a class with a different interface. The Adapter Pattern is also known as Wrapper.

## Builder Design Pattern
Builder Pattern says that "construct a complex object from simple objects using step-by-step approach".It is mostly used when object can't be created in single step like in the de-serialization of a complex object.
